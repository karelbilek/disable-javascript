Safari port of

https://github.com/dpacassi/disable-javascript

Barely working. I will fix it up later if/when I have time.

Unfortunately does not block inline scripts like the original, only blocks JS, but that is enough.

There are a lot of issues, I will need to write up how to build it later.

I still have lot of printf/console.log everywhere, will clean it up later

As this is my first XCode/Swift thing, it's horrible code.
